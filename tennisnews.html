                <h3>Andy Roddick Criticizes Nick Kyrgios' 'Influencer' Behavior</h3>
                <p>Nick Kyrgios stood on Centre Court at Wimbledon following his four-set loss to Novak Djokovic in July and was asked by the BBC’s Sue Barker if reaching his first grand slam final made him hungry for more.

“Absolutely not, honestly,” he said with a laugh. “I’m so tired. Myself and my team are so exhausted. I’ve played so much tennis. I definitely need a well-earned vacation after this one.”

It was a non-traditional answer from perhaps the world’s most non-traditional player, as he stayed in character as tennis’ anti-establishment poster child.

And then, of course, he zagged once again when people thought he would zig, playing a very busy summer schedule in the run-up to the US Open in New York. Kyrgios played singles and doubles at almost every stop, winning both tournaments in hot conditions in Washington D.C. </p>

                <h3>Djokovic Clinches 25th Grand Slam Title</h3>
                <p>The 37-year-old was made to work in his 430th Grand Slam singles match but he emerged triumphant, beating qualifier Jaime Faria 6-1 6-7 (4-7) 6-3 6-2.

The win gives Djokovic sole ownership of the all-time record for most Grand Slam singles matches played among men and women, and takes him past former rival Federer, who played his last major match at Wimbledon in 2021.

"I love this sport. I love competition," Djokovic said when asked about the milestone. </p>

                <p>Former World No. 1, Naomi Osaka, has announced her return to the WTA tennis circuit.

Having held the top ranking in January 2019, Osaka briefly regained it in August of the same year. Osaka expressed her excitement about returning to play in Brisbane.

The Brisbane event serves as a warm-up for the Australian Open Grand Slam, beginning on December 31st and concluding on January 7th. </p>
