                The global cricketing bodies, including the International Cricket Council (ICC), are collaborating with the IOC to ensure a successful event. Many see this as a chance for cricket to showcase its ability to unite people across cultures and geographies. With cricket’s Olympic return, the stage is set for the sport to reach unprecedented levels of global recognition and celebration.</p>
